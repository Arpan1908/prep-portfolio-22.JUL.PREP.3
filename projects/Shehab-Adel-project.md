## Inspiration

I got its inspiration while I was looking for summer Internships, I had to collect the tech stack of the companies and saved it in a Notion database. Then I thought, why wouldn't I make it public in a web platform? Something like Stackshare.io. i believe it's going to revolutionize the tech community in Egypt and everywhere in the future.

## What it does

Stack Info allows users to explore stack technologies used by more than 200 startups and corporates in Egypt, and EMEA in the future. This allows tech community to get exposed to the companies that use their tech stack, which enhances the job search as well.

## How I built it

Created the frontend, then the backend, then linked both together. It's better to work on both in parallel actually.

## Challenge I ran into while building 

I was working on it by myself, and I was learning on it actually. So it took me some time to build it.
