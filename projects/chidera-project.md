## Inspiration

Quick question, What's the perfect job opening? off the top of my head I'd say one with an amazing pay check with requirements that match my skill set. Many times we come across these kinds of jobs and almost immediately commit, in our heads, to send in applications. More often than not we completely forget to apply or we lose track of the application's status when we send them.



## What it does

Tracker helps users to keep track of pending job applications and ensure that they get back to them through timely email reminders. It also serves as a useful tool to analyse submitted applications

## How I built it

The following technologies were researched and implemented during the project course:

Technologies Used

Front end : React.js and CSS.
Back end : AppWrite's backend services
DigitalOcean VPS: Used to host Appwrite's instance
